# Linux-Web-Server

## Objective:

Setup a Linux server to serve the Item-Catalog application we created earlier in the Full Stack Nanodegree course. Once the server is setup, we will secure it through addressing file permissions on the application files, configuring the ports on firewall (within Lightsail and inside the VM), and securing connection to the database.
